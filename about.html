                <p>
                    I’m Toon, 18 years old and a passionate programmer with a wide range of interests — 
                    from watching anime to experimenting with Raspberry Pi projects. What truly drives me 
                    is the process of creating: coming up with ideas, building them, and finally seeing 
                    my own products and projects come to life. I find joy in combining creativity and 
                    technology to bring ideas into reality.

                <h2>Khaqan</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Khaqan, 20 years old, and I have a strong interest in design and visual aesthetics. 
                    I find it important that things not only look good, but also communicate a clear mood. 
                    In my free time, I like experimenting with new styles and color combinations, drawing 
                    inspiration from fashion and modern art. Within this project, I mainly focus on the styling 
                    of the product and its presentation. I aim to make SWAG something that is not only functional 
                    but also visually stands out.

                <h2>Joep</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Joep, 19 years old, and currently in my first year of the CMGT study. In my free time, 
                    I enjoy bouldering, sailing, gaming and of course getting enough sleep to recharge. In this 
                    project, I mainly focused on assembling the physical product. I was responsible for mounting 
                    the different parts and testing the construction.

                <p>
                    I’m Robin, 19 years old, a creative mind with a passion for music and design. Music plays a 
                    big role in my life — especially hip-hop inspires me every day. In my free time, I enjoy 
                    playing fighting games like Street Fighter 6, where I really value the challenge and strategy. 
                    Within this project, I mainly focus on designing and building the website. I enjoy combining 
                    aesthetics and functionality to create something that not only looks good but also truly works.
